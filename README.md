## Ruben's Lunchbox

This is my random box of one-off scripts, config files, and notes. Many of these were imported from GitHub Gists and other places. Each file should be self-contained.

### Dedication

This repo is named for [Brandon's Lunchbox], a 1989 DOS game that was my first introduction to computers. Like this repo, it had a bunch of random little games that taught me things. Now this is doing the same thing.
